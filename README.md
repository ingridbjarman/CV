## Ingrid Bjarman

A frontend developer's backend-developing daughter. I get excited about meeting new people, and I never stop looking for new things to learn. Early last year, I was handed a laptop with a beginner's coding course set up, and I have since followed in my father's footsteps by completing an intensive coding boot camp, developing a passion for TDD and AGILE practices along the way. This has made me realise that there is more to programming than a giant wall of incomprehensible text (though there is definitely some of that too), and from the moment I printed my first “Hello World!”, I was hooked.

Creating solutions to problems I encounter has always been a big interest of mine. As a child, I would build countless constructions to solve issues - such as the lack of transport systems between the floor and my bunk bed for all of my teddies (pulley system in place of a lift, and shopping bag parachutes for the way down), or my sister constantly leaving my door open (weighted closing mechanism using bottle filled with rice and some string). 

I believe this will be advantageous in the world of software, and I am confident I could bring a unique perspective on the issues I would be facing, whether that is technical or team related.

I am a so-called “people person”, and have always taken great pride in my ability to connect with and work alongside people in almost any setting. Before Makers Academy, I already had experience with communication and leadership courses through my time at Lundellska Skolans Gymnasium back in Sweden. I was really able to put my skills to the test here at Makers - 16 weeks of intensive studying can be incredibly stressful, and definitely makes group work taxing. I have had many opportunities to utilise my skills to ensure smooth sailing during projects, such as providing mediation between team members who disagreed about the direction of our final project, or taking charge and making a decision for the group when all of us were feeling indecisive. It's a fine balance between initiative and being too overbearing, but I am confident I walk it well.

Being organised is something I value in myself, I love the rush of juggling multiple things seeing them all slot into place like pieces of a puzzle. I think I automatically view the task of organisation as a challenge, being a problem solver by default, and it has been a hugely useful skill in many ways. Through many stages of life, this has come into play, starting with my time at school where I was juggling school work, a job in hospitality, and arranging the end of year formal. As a nanny, my last job was working with three children of ages ranging from toddlerhood to preteen, and a puppy on top of that, all of which had drastically different needs. Needless to say, staying organised was key. Finally, during my time at Makers, it's been up to me to create structure and routine for myself. This was quite new to me, and I did have moments where I struggled, but I am pleased with how well I managed my workload.
